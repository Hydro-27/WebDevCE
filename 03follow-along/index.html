        <h2>What it says</h2>
        <p>The Declaration of Independence states the principles on which our government, and our identity as Americans, are <strong>based.</strong> Unlike the other founding documents, the Declaration of Independence is not legally binding, but it is powerful. Abraham Lincoln called it <strong>“a rebuke and a stumbling-block to tyranny and oppression.”</strong> It continues to inspire people around the world to fight for freedom and equality.</p>
        <p>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.

            <li>
                    These three documents, known collectively as the Charters of Freedom, have secured the rights of the American people for more than two and a quarter centuries and are considered instrumental to the founding and philosophy of the United States.
            </li>


            <li>
The Declaration of Independence expresses the ideals on which the United States was founded and the reasons for separation from Great Britain.
