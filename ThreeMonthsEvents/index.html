           <p>
            For my birthday we went to my cousins house to have a sleepover for a few days. We played tons of games and had a lot of fun. And had a nightmare experience at 3am with a haunted lampost outside on the street. We will all now have lasting trauma for years to come. :D

              <p>
                 A patriotic celebration of the day that the pumpkins had an uprising against the human race, and overtook our government for almost a full 3 months until the armed forces finally penetrated the inner defences on Oct, 13th 2021. This day is a reminder of those whos lives were effected by this unexpected event.

           Halloween Night
           </h3>

             <p>
                 On this spooky night everyone dresses up in their best costume to go trick-or-treating... until the sprinklers turn on. Its tradition to watch a scary movie on Halloween and almost seen as a rite of passage each time. Though most people end up putting on the same thing every year, either Hocus Pocus or Nightmare Before Christmas. So instead I prefer to play Battlefront all night on survival.

            <h3>Christmas Eve</h3>

             <p>
                For those who believe in the magic of Christmas it is easily the longest night of the entire year. But for those of us who had our fantasies shattered, it remains a peaceful time sitting by the Christmas tree with a cup of Hot Coca. It is a very nice and heartwarming experience for a while, until you remeber that there is work to be done and no time for rest. So that once peaceful night turns into stacking gifts and shoving things that shouldn't fit into the stockings. 10/10 experience.
             </p>

            <h3>Christmas Morning</h3>

             <p>
                For kids: A magical day filled with joy and excitement around every turn. <br>
                For anyone who stayed up the previous night: If you got any sleep at all, it is now time to open gifts at 5am. Or whenever people come bursting into your room. As you slugishly awaken from your slumber, still wearing those matching pajamas with everyone else that are probably much too small, you remember that its time to open gifts. Making your way to the main room where everyone is gathered, you come out to see one of two things: either everyone has already started ripping up their own gifts and the floor is no more visible. And after the 5 min of rush is over then it's time to clean up all the wrapping paper. Or you come out to see everyone waiting impatiently until everybody is out there. And those who woke up early have to stay away from the tree and make sure nothing is touched for 2 hours until everyone is up. In my case its always the second one... In the end though Christmas is filled with joy, graditude, and satisfaction. Until you realize its another 365 days till next Christmas. :)
