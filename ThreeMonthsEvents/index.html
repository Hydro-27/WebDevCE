            For my birthday we went to my cousins house to have a sleepover for a few days. We played tons of games and had a lot of fun.

            The Pumpkin Revolution
           </h3>
   
           <p>
           A patriotic celebration of the day that the pumpkins had an uprising against the human race, and overtook our government for almost a full 3 months until the armed forces finally penetrated the inner defences on Oct, 13th 2021. This day is a reminder of those whos lives were effected by this unexpected event.
