  <h1 class="page-title">The Three Eras of the Hydroverse</h1>
  <p class="intro">
    The Hydroverse wasn’t built in a day — it grew through time, chaos, and hundreds of ideas.  
    Each era brought something new: discovery, destruction, and rebirth.
  </p>

  <!-- Era I -->
  <section class="era">
    <h2>Era I — The Beginning</h2>
    <p>The dawn of the Hydroverse. Hydro, Nodnarboy, and the early members spawned into a new world filled with ambition and no clue what they were doing. The main cave became their first home, and the world slowly started taking shape.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>First tools crafted</li>
      <li>Main cave base constructed</li>
      <li>First Nether portal opened (and instantly regretted)</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>“It was the age of stone, dirt, and too many creepers.”</blockquote>
  </section>

  <!-- Era II -->
  <section class="era">
    <h2>Era II — The Age of Chaos</h2>
    <p>With power came destruction. Projects got bigger, redstone machines got dumber, and huge problems arose. Friendships were tested in PvP battles that nobody agreed to start. The main cause of split revolved around Mouseketeer123 who slowly started to break the entire server apart.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Massive builds and redstone experiments</li>
      <li>Many members became lost and disappeared for years with few finding their way back</li>
      <li>Debates and fights started to tear everyone apart</li>
    </ul>

  </section>

  <!-- Era III -->
  <section class="era">
    <h2>Era III — The Rebirth</h2>
    <p>After chaos came clarity. The fall had left everyone shaken but soon they began to rebuild. And after not too long everything had returend back to normal, and they could see a new adventure on the horizon.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Return of lost members</li>
      <li>Mouseketeer123 gets put in a MAX security prison</li>
      <li>The start of a new adventure</li>
    </ul>
